[Error - 1:35:00 AM] (1241) Enumeration of workspace source files is taking longer than 10 seconds.
This may be because:
* You have opened your home directory or entire hard drive as a workspace
* Your workspace contains a very large number of directories and files
* Your workspace contains a symlink to a directory with many files
* Your workspace is remote, and file enumeration is slow
To reduce this time, open a workspace directory with fewer files or add a pyrightconfig.json configuration file with an "exclude" section to exclude subdirectories from your workspace. For more details, refer to https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md.
